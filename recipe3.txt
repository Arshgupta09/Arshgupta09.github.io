Bourbon Truffles
Ingredients

8 oz. El Rey Caoba Milk 41% chocolate 
1/3 cup heavy cream
2 tbsps. butter, at room temperature 
2 tbsps. bourbon 
1 lb. milk chocolate, melted and tempered

Method
1.Finely chop the milk chocolate.
2.Bring the heavy cream to a boil. 
3.Remove from the heat and add chocolate. Whisk together until the chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.
4.Add soft butter and bourbon to the chocolate mixture. Whisk together until combined (do not over mix). The ganache should be about the same temperature as the butter when you add the butter (do not add butter to a warm ganache).
5.Allow the ganache to harden. I normally allow the ganache to sit overnight before using it.
6.Scoop truffles with a melon baller.
7.Fill the scoop 3/4 full for average size truffles. Round each truffle between your palms. Chill slightly before dipping or rolling them.
