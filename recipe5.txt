½ cup/125ml plus 2 tbsps./30ml heavy cream 
½ cup/125ml almond butter

1.Bring cream to a boil in a heavy saucepan. Remove from heat.
2.Stir chocolate into cream using a whisk or wooden spoon. Stir until all the chocolate is melted.
3.Add almond butter and almond extract (if desired) and mix thoroughly. Chill in refrigerator until firm (1-3 hours).
4.Using a spoon or melon-ball cutter, form chilled mixture into 1-inch (2.5cm) balls and roll in chopped toasted almonds. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator, well wrapped in plastic, for up to one week.
