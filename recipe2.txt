title Soft Caremals

Ingredients
1 package (12 oz.) Guittard Chocolate Chips of choice 
1/3 cup peanut butter (creamy or crunchy) 
3 cups crispy rice cereal
1 1/4 cups chopped roasted peanuts (reserve 1/2 cup for sprinkling over top of finished squares)

Method

1.Line the bottom and sides of an 8x8-inch pan with plastic wrap so it hangs over the edges and can easily be lifted out after being filled. Set aside.
2.Combine chocolate chips and peanut butter in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat at medium power (50% or level 5) for 2-2 ½ minutes, stirring well after 1 minute initially then at 30 second intervals until smooth and chips are completely melted. Stir in 3/4 cup chopped peanuts and gently stir in cereal so as not to crush cereal and until evenly covered with coating.
3.Spread into prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining chopped peanuts. Refrigerate for about 15-25 minutes or until chocolate has set firmly enough to lift contents out of pan. Cut into small squares. Store covered at cool room temperature or tightly covered in the fridge.
