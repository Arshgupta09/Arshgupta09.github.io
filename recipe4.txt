Ale Truffles

Ingredients
1 cup ale
1/2 cup packed light muscovado sugar
1 lb. Javanese 40% milk chocolate, chopped
14 oz. 70% dark chocolate, tempered (see instructions)

Method

1.Put 1/4 cup of the ale and the sugar in a saucepan and stir over low heat until the sugar is fully dissolved. Add the remaining ale and warm until you can see the alcohol's vapors being released from the surface. The ale needs only to be warm enough to melt the chocolate – overheating it will cook off the alcohol which is the natural preservative in this ganache.
2.Pour the ale into a blender and add the chocolate gradually on medium speed until smooth. Cool for 30 minuyrd and pipe into prepared shells, or leave to set in the fridge, then hand roll into truffles. Use the tempered chocolate for coating.
3.A simple decoration of piped milk chocolate looks good on these truffles, but is optional.
